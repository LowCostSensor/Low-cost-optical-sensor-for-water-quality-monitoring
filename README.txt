The CAD model as well as the python code refer to a low-cost optical sensor prototype based on Raspberry pi Zero W. This prototype was used for the analysis of Ponceau-S in water. The case of the instrument allows the user to perform distance experiments thanks to two endless screw that move the slots that host the breadbords. A final CAD and an updated python code for the determination of nitrates and phosphates using colorimetric kits will be released soon.
