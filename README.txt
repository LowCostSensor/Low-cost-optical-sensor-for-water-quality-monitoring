A portable, low-cost optical sensor for community-based monitoring of nitrates and orthophosphates in freshwater were developed. Its analytical performance and reliability were demonstrated in both laboratory conditions and the intended operational environment, with all components fully integrated. This achievement corresponds to a technological readiness level of 7-8. All necessary information for reproducing the sensor, including a 3D CAD model, software, and a user guide for setup and usage, has been made open-source. The same colorimetric kits employed in this study are currently utilized in 110 active citizen science projects across Europe and Africa. By improving the accuracy of these colorimetric kits, the proposed instrument has the potential to empower citizen science monitoring, breaking barriers to data integration between environmental agencies and community-driven monitoring. Nonetheless, further durability testing and inter-project validation could enhance the sensor’s reliability. Future work will focus on integrating fluorescence measurements, scattering correction, multispectral capabilities, and app-based functionality to expand the sensor’s applications and usability.
